; Lock Horizontal Mouse Axys for better BÃ©zier keyframe handling

win_lockMouseY(unlockKey="Esc") {

  ; I dont know why!! But if it locks the y axis to the current mouse pos, my mouse jumps 8px down...
  ; ...so this is the workaround:
  mouseOffsetY = -8 ; maybe change this to your needs

  MouseGetPos, , mouseY
  tooltip, Y axis locked
  ClipCursor( 0, mouseY+mouseOffsetY, A_ScreenWidth, mouseY+1+mouseOffsetY )
  Keywait, %unlockKey%
  DllCall("ClipCursor") ; disable ClipCursor
  tooltip,

}

; this is where the magic happens:
ClipCursor( x1=0 , y1=0, x2=1, y2=1 ) {
  VarSetCapacity(R,16,0),  NumPut(x1,&R+0),NumPut(y1,&R+4),NumPut(x2,&R+8),NumPut(y2,&R+12)
  Return DllCall( "ClipCursor", UInt,&R )
}
